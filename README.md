This example demonstrates a common SQL error: attempting to use an aggregate function (like SUM()) in the WHERE clause before the aggregate has been calculated.  The `total_sales` alias is not yet available in the WHERE clause because it's defined in the SELECT clause.  This will result in a syntax error or unexpected results. The solution shows how to correctly use a HAVING clause to filter after the aggregation has occurred.
